UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding in HTML that allows you to represent a vast range of characters and symbols from different languages and scripts. Let’s explore the significance of UTF-8 in HTML:

What is UTF-8?
UTF-8 stands for Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit.
It is a variable-length character encoding that uses 1 to 4 bytes to represent characters.
UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII, which means that the first 128 characters (ASCII characters) have the same binary values in UTF-8.
It is the preferred encoding for emails, web pages, and other text-based content.
Why Use UTF-8 in HTML?
Universal Character Set: Unicode defines all characters needed for writing most living languages used on computers. It covers almost all characters, punctuations, and symbols worldwide.
Platform and Language Independence: UTF-8 enables processing, storage, and transport of text independent of platform and language.
Web Compatibility: HTML5 pages default to using UTF-8 as the character encoding. It ensures compatibility across different browsers and multilingual environments.
Avoid Unexpected Results: Using UTF-8 simplifies authoring pages and prevents unexpected issues with form submissions and URL encodings.
HTML5 and UTF-8:
The default character encoding in HTML5 is UTF-8.
If you need to specify a different character set, you can use the <meta> tag in your HTML document. For example:
HTML

<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">

However, it’s recommended to stick with UTF-8 for broader compatibility.
